Coranimus
=========

Coranimus is a heart-rate monitor designed to look after your vitals signs for heart and anxiety situations.

So far this project is in a really alpha stage, i'm building a first complete version then looking to clean up the code, design a better UX and add more devices support.

It's using Android version 4.3 or more for Bluetooth Low Energy support.
